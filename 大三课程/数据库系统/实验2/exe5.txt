1.List the department number and average salary of each department.
 	SELECT DEPTNO, AVG(SAL) AS avg_salary
	FROM emp2022150221
	GROUP BY DEPTNO;

2.Divide all employees into groups by department and by job within department. Count the employees in each group and compute each group's average annual salary.
	SELECT DEPTNO, JOB, COUNT(*) AS num_employees, AVG(SAL * 12) AS avg_annual_salary
	FROM emp2022150221	
	GROUP BY DEPTNO, JOB
	ORDER BY DEPTNO;

3.Issue the same query as above except list the department name rather than the department number.
	SELECT d.DNAME, JOB, COUNT(*) AS num_employees, AVG(SAL * 12) AS avg_annual_salary
	FROM emp2022150221 as e
	JOIN dept2022150221 as d ON e.DEPTNO = d.DEPTNO
	GROUP BY e.DEPTNO, JOB
	ORDER BY e.DEPTNO;

4.List the average annual salary for all job groups having more than 2 employees in the group.
	SELECT JOB, AVG(SAL * 12) AS avg_annual_salary
	FROM emp2022150221 
	GROUP BY JOB
	HAVING COUNT(*)>2;

5.Find all departments with an average commission greater than 25% of average salary.
	SELECT
    		DEPTNO,
    		AVG(COMM),
    		AVG(SAL),
  		AVG(SAL)/AVG(COMM) as proportion
	FROM
    		emp2022150221
	GROUP BY
    		DEPTNO
	HAVING
    		AVG(COMM) > AVG(SAL) * 0.25;

6.Find each department's average annual salary for all its employees except the managers and the president.
	SELECT
    		DEPTNO,
    		AVG(SAL * 12) AS avg_annual_salary
	FROM
    		emp2022150221
	WHERE
    		JOB NOT IN('MANAGER', 'PRESIDENT')
	GROUP BY
    		DEPTNO;
