 法一：	
	SELECT
 		 SUM(CASE WHEN e.SAL IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NUM_SAL,

	FROM
 		 emp2022150221 AS e
	WHERE
 		 e.DEPTNO = 30;
法二：
	SELECT
 		 COUNT(e.SAL IS NOT NULL OR NULL) AS NUM_SAL,
 		 COUNT(e.COMM IS NOT NULL OR NULL) AS NUM_COMM
	FROM
  		emp2022150221 AS e
	WHERE
		e.DEPTNO = 30;

6	List the average commission of employees who receive a commission, and the average commission of all employees (assume employees who do not receive a commission attract zero commission)
	SELECT
  		AVG(e.COMM) AS AVG_COMM_RECEIVED,
 		 AVG(CASE WHEN e.COMM IS NOT NULL THEN e.COMM ELSE 0 END) AS AVG_COMM_ALL
	FROM
  		emp2022150221 AS e;

7	List the average salary of employees that receive a salary, the average commission of employees that receive a commission, the average 	salary plus commission of only those employees that receive a commission and the average salary plus commission of all employees including  those that do not receive a commission. (single statement)

	FROM
		emp2022150221 AS e;
	
8	Compute the daily and hourly salary for employees in department 30, 	round to the nearest penny. Assume there are 22 working days in a month and 8 working hours in a day.
	SELECT
  		e.EMPNO,
  		e.ENAME,
  		ROUND(e.SAL / 22, 2) AS DailySalary,
 		 ROUND((e.SAL / 22) / 8, 2) AS HourlySalary
	FROM
  		emp2022150221 AS e
	WHERE
 		 e.DEPTNO = 30;

9	Issue the same query as the previous one except that this time truncate (TRUNC) to the nearest penny rather than round.
	SELECT
  		  e.EMPNO,
    		 e.ENAME,
   		 TRUNCATE(e.SAL / 22, 2) AS DailySalary,
    		TRUNCATE((e.SAL / 22) / 8,2) AS HourlySalary
